# The file plugin loads files from a directory and defines them as
# variables for use in your stories. Ie: if you have a file named 
# "foo", then the variable $file::foo will be set to the contents
# of the file "foo" and will be substituted in your stories and such.
# Files are loaded from $plugin_dir/filedata

package file;

my $datadir;

# Startup - scan filedata dir, read files into variables
sub start {
  $datadir = $blosxom::plugin_dir . "/filedata";

  if ( $datadir and opendir D, $datadir ) {
    foreach my $f (readdir D) {
      next unless -f "$datadir/$f";
      open F, "$datadir/$f";
      $$f = join('', <F>);
      close F;
    }

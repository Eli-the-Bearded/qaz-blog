Post Filter

.p
So I started working on a method to compose posts _better_, for my idea
of better at least. Version one of `qzpostfilt` (and a README and some
test code) is available in the
.a https://github.com/eli-the-bearded/qaz-blog "git repo"
and browsable
.a /qz/etc/qzpf/ "here."
./p

.p
It's a mis-mash of Markdown and `nroff`/`troff` style commands. I picked
what I thought the easiest to remember _and_ to type on a phone keyboard
methods of composing my posts would be. Basically you have markdown
style inline formatting for *bold*, _italic_, `code` and *roff style
formatting for more block level stuff. As a general rule: `.foo` creates
`&lt;foo>` and you need to explicitly close your `./foo`.
./p

.d imgbox
.i /qz/img/xterm-screenshot.png "my xterm composing this post"
.p
It ends up looking more like *roff than markdown.
./p
./d

.p
I see this as the first step towards a composing tool. I'll also need a
CGI wrapper for phone use and a command line wrapper to help with tags.
As of today, it's more of a `:% !qzpostfilt` in `vi` sort of thing.
./p

.p
Also in blosxom blog news, I've changed the html flavor templates slightly
and made changes to the
.a /qz/css/main.css "CSS file"
mostly to better support reading on small screens, but also for a `&lt;ul>`
class to use in 
.a /qz/?tag=recipe "recipe posts."
./p

Lastly, I added another two dozen logos to the mix. Previously there had been 146, so
it's up to 170 now. I don't recall how I created the first logos, this time my method
was to type "QZ" in libreoffice, change the font size to 180, and then go through
the fonts I have installed, screenshotting all the interesting ones. I next very roughly
cropped the images so that each QZ was alone on a white background. From there I
started scripting the work.
./p

<pre>
# for every png file, convert to ppm (RGB color), auto-crop a white border,
# convert to pgm (grayscale), rescale so ysize (height) is 100 pixels,
# convert to png making white (and only exactly white) transparent, saving
# that result in the "new" directory
for f in *png ; do pngtoppm $f | pnmcrop -white | ppmtopgm | 
   pnmscale -ysize 100 | pnmtopng -transparent =white > new/$f ; done
</pre>

.p
(That's something I need to add to `qzpostfilt`: a
`&lt;pre>` handler. Todo. Hand fix for now.)
./p

.p
A second, messier, pass with `identify` got me the files renamed
to look like "linux-biolinum-keys-h100-w205.png" instead of
"linux-biolinum-keys.png". My `randomlogo` plugin uses the height
and width information when available.
./p

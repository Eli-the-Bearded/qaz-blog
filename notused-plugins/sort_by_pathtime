=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: sort_by_pathtime

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is a modification of the sort_by_path plugin. It sorts the top
page strictly by reverse cronological, then subpages by directory
and reverse cronological.

Use in concert with an appropriate "date" replacement, using path instead
of date as the divider.  E.g.:  <p><b>$path</b></p>

Overrides Blosxom's default sort() subroutine.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Drop the sort_by_pathtime  plug-in into your Blosxom plugins folder.

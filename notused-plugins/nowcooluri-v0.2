=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: CoolURI

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Purpose: Hack URIs to allow extension free, date based permalinks, as
described in http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI

Description

When running dynamically, intercepts any path of the form
/yyyy/mm/dd/name and returns that document in the default flavour.

Configuration

None

Additional Bits Required 

None

Category
/display ?

Date
2003-09-06

Todo list

Add an equivalent behaivour for the static case, so that all of the
indices get generated appropriately (not sure how to do this without
stamping on all other entries-overiding plugins; does this matter,
though?)
